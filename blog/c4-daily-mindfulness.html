                <h1>Daily Mindfulness</h1>
              <!-- Edit content -->
                <h2>What did you learn from your 'mindfulness conversation'? How did the other person find it?</h2>
                <p>It certainly felt very good being able to speak and be listened to, and she felt the same way. I believe this is a practice I've acquired naturally but verbally repeating what they have said and ensuring that I've captured what their saying made her felt great too. It certainly made me feel that we both fully understood and took onboard what we were trying to communicate.</p>
                <h2>Which of the three suggested techniques will you use to sustain your practice?</h2>
                <p>Definately the conversational mindfulness.</p>
                <h2>Any other musings?</h2>
                <p>I think this was the chapter that really captured me so far as it's more about mindfulness in a practical sense like a conversation. I can see how this will help in the future for sure.</p>
