                        The Pomodoro Technique seems right up my alley with a mix of timeboxing. I think that meditation is also something I've already started to slowly get into, but in a different sense from the norm. I've been using ASMR for a few months now and it's started to grow on me.

                    What is meant by boxifying design?

                        I certainly find the meditation side of things interesting, as you can see how meditation affects the brain through scans etc. It's pretty fascinating and I think it's going to be something that will grow on me. I also found the Pomodoro Technique very interesting as it sort of fits my current workstlye at the moment but it now gives it some structure.

                        The meditiaton worked, ASMR is something I really, really, really love.
