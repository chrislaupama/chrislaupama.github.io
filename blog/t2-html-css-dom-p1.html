    <h2>Q&A</h2>
    <h3>Which timebox and habits techniques did you try?</h3>
    
    <p>
      The Pomodoro Technique seems right up my alley with a mix of timeboxing. I think that meditation is also something I've already started to slowly get into, but in a different sense from the norm. I've been using ASMR for a few months now and it's started to grow on me.
    </p>
    <h3>
      What did you find interesting?
    </h3>
    <p>
      I certainly find the meditation side of things interesting, as you can see how meditation affects the brain through scans etc. It's pretty fascinating and I think it's going to be something that will grow on me. I also found the Pomodoro Technique very interesting as it sort of fits my current workstlye at the moment but it now gives it some structure.

    <h3>
      What worked for you?
    </h3>
    <p>
      The meditiaton worked, ASMR is something I really, really, really love.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Which will you experiment further with?
    </h3>
    <p>
      I will experiment with meditation more for sure, I'm keen to see how that goes, especially with the different techniques. I also really want to use the Pomodoro and Timebox techniques. I really like the way they structure things.
