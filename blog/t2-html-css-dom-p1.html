                <h3>Can you think of an analogy to describe HTML, CSS and the DOM? How would you describe it to your non-technical friend?</h3>
                    <p>
                    A good way to explain the HTML, CSS and the DOM and the relevance of them to each other would be much like building a house, the materials and how to read the blueprints in an easy to read format.
                    </p>
                    <h4>HTML</h4>
                    <p>
                    HTML is like the frame work of the house. HTML will tell you...
                        <uo>
                            <li>How many levels the house has</li>
                            <li>How many rooms are on each level</li>
                            <li>Where each room is positioned</li>
                            <li>How each room positioned in comparison to other rooms</li>
                            <li>The contents within each room/level like does it have carpet, windows, lights etc</li>
                        </uo>
                    </p>
                    <h4>CSS</h4>
                    <p>
                    CSS is the material, and wallpaper, carpet and colours of each for each room, level, house, window etc
                    </p>
                <h3>
                    What is meant by boxifying design?
                </h3>
                    <p>
                        Boxifying design is to basically image a website broken up into boxes. So imagine havine a grid layered over a website design, from there you can see what elements will fit into boxes. Some boxes will contain boxes within them and that's to help section off certain areas with "div" commands so it becomes easier to know the heirarchy of the elements and what their parent container/box is.
                    </p>
                <h3>
                    What is the box model?
                </h3>
                    <p>
                        The box model is to give each element substance to a degree. It all starts with content, which then has a margin, borders, padding etc. This allows the developer to shape/position the content in a way that makes that content sit in a clear position against the surrounding content.
