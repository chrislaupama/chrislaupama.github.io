              <!-- Edit content -->
                <h3>How did the 'process over product' concept affect the way you tackled the site redesign and rebuild?</h3>
                <p>The process wasn't too bad, I haven't touched code in over a month due to work, however picking it up again (referring back to notes and find answers online) I found myself recalling how things worked again.</p>
                <p>The one thing that was pretty hard for me was to stop... I want it to be perfect and function a particular way, so It became something I had to force myself to stop working on. I could keep tweaking, designing and making it look good until the cows come home.</p>
                <h3>What did you think about meditation before reading chapter 2?</h3>
                <p>I've always felt that it would be something difficult for me to fully grasp and understand, but as I continue to read these chapters I'm getting a better grasp on the simplicity of it all.</p>
                <h3>What new things have you learnt about meditation?</h3>
                <p>I like the way that in this chapeter it spoke about meditation being like going to the gym and exercising your muscles, it put the whole meditation thing into perspective for me especially knowing that it can become easier and work for you throughout the day too, it's not just something you only benefit from during meditation</p>
                <h3>Did any of the suggested meditation techniques stand out to you?</h3>
                <p>I think that outlining the different postures and the 7-steps really made it easy for me to understand where I can start, my default thought would be just to mimmic people I see meditating on TV (lol) but there's more to it then that, and you can even do it while lying down too! (but I will probably fall asleep, so will need to keep my eyes open)</p>
                <h3>Any other musings?</h3>
                <p>The results from the studies was pretty interesting.</p>
