                <h3>Have you tried using any of the insight and techniques for growing trust and sincerity? How did it go?</h3>
                <p>I have in the past without knowing all this knowledge about it, I think I naturally have always done this as I'm a pretty empathetic person and tend to trust that people are in the same or similar positions as me. </p>
                <h3>Try empathic listening - how did it go?</h3>
                <p>Empathetic listening is also something I've kind of always naturally done. I even recently went through this last week with a family member who was going through some hard times, it feels good to have the person know that you can feel and hear their issues and that you're fully listening to them.</p>
                <h3>How did you find the loving kindness meditation?</h3>
                <p>It was okay, I will need to do it more to feel the full impact of it. </p>
                <h3>Complete the political awareness exercise here in writing.</h3>
                <p>At the moment I currently live with my little sister and she works full time in finance. During the day while I study I do all the house work (including her washing etc), It's natural for me to just grab all the washing and clean them all, same with the dishes, however, I also feel like it's a bit unfair for her to now just expect this to be done.</p>
                <p>Sisters point of view - I currently work pretty full on hours as I'm saving for my trip to europe next year. I know that Chris does a lot of work around home, and I appreciate it. By the time I get home I'm exhausted and just want to have dinner and go to sleep, I know I should do more, but at the moment I am so full on I barely have time for myself.</p>
