                <h2>What is grid based design?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Grid based design is where you segment the design of the website into a grid, much like box design, in fact they are relatively similar. 
                    </p>

                <h2>Whats all the hype about responsive webpages?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Responsive webpages is all about making your website look and perform in a way that is aesthetically pleasing regardless of what device you are viewing the page from. So if you're looking at the page on a mobile device, desktop or even a TV it will still look good.
                    </p>

                <h2>What is semantic structure?</h2>
                    <p>
                        The semantic structure is thinking about the semantic tags you will use to start converting your design into code. It's the next step you would take after slicing the design up into grids. This way you are able to practically read the visual design more like a blueprint.
                    </p>
                
                <h2>Any other points you found interesting and want to reflect on.</h2>
                    <p>
                        Learning about grids was great, but I certainly found that the bootstrap and frameworks additional tutorial was HUGELY valuable. It does take up quite some time, but I can see how this would be HUGELY valuable to everyone!
