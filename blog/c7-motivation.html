                <h3>How does life look through the 'pleasure, passion and purpose' lens?</h3>
                <p>I found this concept very interesting and is certainly something I'm currently working through purposely. I believe that most people do focus a little through the pleasure lens a little more than the others, which isn't very sustainable. Passion is something I feel like I tend to sit in with purpose. However, I think that focusing on my purpose some more is something I want to focus on more. Basically focusing/working on something you like with an overall purpose and end goal is the way to be. Have a strong purpose on something I like, which will make me naturally work on it with passion and there will also be pleasurable moments throughout that whole process. </p>
                <h3>What are your core values?</h3>
                <p>Reliability, Honesty and Accountability are probably the core values I focus on and tend to be the ones that I naturally gravitate towards within others too.</p>
                <h3>What do you stand for?</h3>
                <p>Growth, within myself and others that surround me. No matter what it is, I like to see others around me grow, and I like to help them grow too. It's something that I have only recently started to fully put into myself but I like to help people and push them to take risks and achieve what they want to.</p>
                <h3>How did you find the resilience ideas and meditation exercise?</h3>
                <p>It seems pretty similar to the last chapters meditation session, however I can see how this will benefit me in the long run. Meditation is certainly something I'm going to continuely get used to.</p>
