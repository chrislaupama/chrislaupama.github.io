                <h1>Self Confidence</h1>
              <!-- Edit content -->
                <h2>What is the relationship between mindfulness and self awareness?</h2>
                <p>Like in the chapter explains, they are pretty damn similar however, mindfulness is more of a in the moment, present, now sort of state while self-aware is more of an ability to understand our own limitations or strenghts, weaknesses etc. </p>
                <h2>Try at least one of the self awareness practices from the chapter (Body Scan, Journaling). What was your experience of it? How did you feel?</h2>
                <p>So I tried both. The body scan reminds me alot of an old hypnosis MP3 I had when I was like 13/14. I used to use it all the time to help me get to sleep. In the hypnosis audio it would have a guy with a deep and slow voice whisper stuff like "imagine you're on a beach and you can feel the sun rays touch the top of your head, down to your neck and shoulders... etc. It reminded me of that big time, but rather than the sensation of the suns rays and warmth, it's more being mindful of them being present.</p>
                <p>The Journaling is something that I've always been keen on doing, but too lazy to do. Recentlty I purchased a great app called Grid. It's a calendar app that has daily questions split up into a grid, naturally it has a grid space for how you felt today, how the weather was, and then also other custom ones, so using the examples in the chapters I've filled them in to start asking them to me daily. I did find the exercise really fascinating as I didn't think I could write that much in a short amount of time lol.</p>
                <h2>What did you take away from the "My Emotions are Not Me" section?</h2>
                <p>I did find it interesting as I am one to say "I am sad" etc and it is just labelling myself as sad. It was very interesting and it instantly made me think of my kids when they say it, for now I will just correct them and say "no, you're feeling sad" but in time will get them to flesh it out a bit more. I found it interesting.</p>
