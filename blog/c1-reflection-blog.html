    <h3>What's your take on the DBC/EDA experience?</h3>
    
    <p>
      I think that the DBC/EDA experience is all about realising that this is an opportunity that we all need to take very seriously and to utilise our time at EDA to soak up as much as we can. It's all about finding that self drive. It's about finding the "why" and focusing on the why as it will help drive you through. EDA certainly isn't meant to be easy, however, this is why it's called a bootcamp, there will be ups and downs but in the end it's all about the effort that we put into it that makes it what it is.

    <h3>
      What are your impressions?
    </h3>
    <p>
      I find it very refreshing, it's so true, and I can completely understand why these mindsets are so common, however, I find it encouraging knowing that EDA really push that self drive. I think that the table mindset is something I have certainly noticed in jobs with other people, I've always been very passionate and heavily involved with my jobs, and have always found this a little frustrating with others who are just there to pickup their paycheck. I love the culture and mindset of bringing people together to share a common goal. I'm not perfect at all, however, at times I know that sometimes you do need a little lift or encouragement to keep going and it all ends up coming down to that common goal and the "why".

    <h3>
      How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?
    </h3>
    <p>
      I personally believe that I will thrive in this type of culture, however, I still have  alot to learn so I that it's important to me that others are also driven too so we can all benefit from each others drive and knowledge.

    <h3>
      Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?
    </h3>
    <p>
      Not really, I certainly knew about this from all the research i've done on EDA, especially the webinars.

    <h3>
      Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?
    </h3>
    <p>
      I'm certainly excited, but as I said earlier, I am nervous because I have a lot to learn in a short amount of time. Going through this first sprint I felt like i've learnt a truckload and it is actually very exciting and personally very addictive.
