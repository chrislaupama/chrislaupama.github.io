        </div>

                <h2>What a responsive site is, and why responsiveness is important.</h2>
                    <p>
                        A responsive site is a website that will move/change shap and format itself to the screen/device you are viewing the website on. Experiencing a website built to look good on a large desktop screen may not look so good on a smaller screen, so having the ability for the website to be viewable on any screen size is extremely important.
                    </p>

                <h2>What mobile first design is, and why it's important.</h2>
                    <p>
                        Today most people are using their mobile devices to view websites primarily over desktops. So having the mindset of the website functioning and looking good on a mobile device first is key to ensuring that the user experience is what you would like it to be on a smaller screen. It's extremely important to design for mobile first as most people use their mobile devices over a desktop to view sites while on the go.
                    </p>

                <h2>What frameworks are, and their pros and cons</h2>
                    <p>
                        Frameworks are a set of code that the webdeveloper can use to make design a lot easier. A framework is kind of like a template, a framework can contain all the code for a nice looking button for example and all the web developer has to do to use that code is to add a tiny bit of code so the website knows to display that button in the way a framework has designed buttons to look like.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The pros of using a framework is the fact that it keeps all of your elements looking/functioning the same, and it also helps a tonne when it comes to the layout of the site. The cons are the fact that you can go through a tonne of code to slighlty modify how a particular piece of code from the framework behaves.
                    </p>
                
                <h2>What a wireframe is and why we use it.</h2>
                    <p>
                        A wireframe is basically a blueprint of a website, it gives the basic outline of how the website will look/function in a very simplistic way. It's like a sketch of a website, and generally you will focus on mobile first, and then design the desktop version, and then figure out how they will function together from there.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Below you will see the basic wireframes for this website. The first two are how the front page was initally going to look like, the second two are how the blog pages were going to look like.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I started coding the intial concept, but it quickly became very time consuming to get it exact. I then ended up settling on a bit of a different concept which to me felt more intuitive. I certainly could've put days and days into this to get it absolutely perfect, but I am on a bit of a time constraint as I was expecting to finish work last week! So for now... this shall do.
