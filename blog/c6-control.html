                <h3>When programming, what are some of your triggers? What causes a disproportionate emotional response?</h3>
                <p>I would say that it's probably the fact that I can learn a new concept, read over it, completely understand it... but when it comes to putting it into a practical situation from scratch I can find things really difficult to know where to start. I then tend to get frustrated, angry and also worried as I feel like I should know it off by heart. It can end up overwhelming me and I get worried... however, after speaking to Engie, she put it all into perspective for me and I know realise that I'm not supposed to just read something and now know it, it's like learning another language, like Japanese or something... I'm not supposed to read the alphabet once and then know it off by heart it will take practice. I know feel a lot better and realise that programming itself is all about constant learning.</p>
                <h3>How did you find the Siberian North Railroad exercise (Stop, Breathe, Notice, Reflect, Respond)?</h3>
                <p>I think it's a concept that we're all too familiar with as we see in a lot of movies, shows, people around us say "take a deep breath, count to 10" when someone gets upset/angry. So learning about it in more depth and understanding why those two steps (and even more steps) are so important truly makes sense. I certainly know I'll be using this technique for sure.</p>
