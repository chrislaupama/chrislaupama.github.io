                <h1>Leadership</h1>
              <!-- Edit content -->
                <h3>What is your experience of compassionate (or not) leadership?</h3>
                <p>In my teen years I had a boss who was very compassionate towards myseld and others. He even helped me in a personal situation (purchased me a car!) based on all the multitude of negatitve situations going on in my life at the time. He was one hell of a good man, and I always ensure I catch up with him at one of his restaurants when I'm in Wellington. I can certainly have experienced a compassionate leader first hand and can see how it makes an impact on people.</p>
                <h3>Do the multiplying goodness meditation. How did you find it?</h3>
                <p>It did seem nice, certainly will take me a while to do it in a purposeful state, however I can certainly understand the benefits.</p>
                <h3>Do the Tonglen meditation. How did you find it?</h3>
                <p>As it says in the book, this is certainly a bit harder to do as it seemd weird... inhaling the bad from myself, like I'm some demon? (lol) - HOWEVER, when I thought of someone else, it actually felt quite good, like I was actually helping them.</p>
                <h3>How does the SCARF model apply to your Phase 0 experience so far? How will it apply to bootcamp?</h3>
                <p>It's quite interesting for me as I can see the "status", "certainty" and "autonomy" aspects of the SCARF model in my learnings with Phase 0 so far. I can also certainly see the the last two "relatedness" and "fairness" along with "status" having a big play at Bootcamp. I'm glad that everyone is reading this book, makes me even more excited to meet everyone too actually.</p>
                <h3>Have a difficult conversation. How did it go? (It's a valuable skill, but can take practice to develop!)</h3>
                <p>It actually went really well! In the end we came to a conclusion and even thought that changing what I wanted to being up would be a great learning exercise for us both. So it was quite valuable to read this chapter before I had to make the call :)</p>
