                <h1>Javascript Basics</h1>
              <!-- Edit content -->
                <h2>How does JavaScript compare to HTML and CSS?</h2>
                <p>Javascript is more of a thinking language, it's a language that is used to work and manipulate data. HTML is the face, the design. CSS is the colours, the aspects that HTML pulls for aesthetic purposes and Javascript is like the brain.</p>
                <h2>Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life, for example 'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth'.</h2>
                <p>Control flow is exactly that, a flow which is in control... think of it like a conveyer belt with specific things happening along that conveyer belt in a particular order. So if a product goes down the conveyer belt it is expected to be put through a set of different sections in order to ensure the product comes out correctly.</p>
                <p>As the product goes through at times there may be things that need to be checked, for example let's say that we want to ensure that the bottle of fizzy drink has the right label on it, this is where we can introduce things like a if statement. The if statement can do things like, IF the bottle has coke in it, put a coke bottle on it, else if it has fanta within in put a fanta label on it, so on and so fourth</p>
                <p>Another thing is that you can have let's say a crate 12 of bottles, and each of them have a different type of fizzy drink inside them, we can then use a loop to check each bottle and then push the bottles along one to check the next and continue until we have completed the maximum amount of bottles that we have (12) in the crate.</p>
                <h2>Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.</h2>
                <p>Imagine that you have a pool table, and you want a specific ball, all you would say is that you want the Black 8 ball (or just the black ball, and we will tell you that the number of that ball is 8). It's easy, short and simple, this is an array. However, if you wanted a specific ojbect from a house that has mutliple rooms, with multiple pool tables you would need to say that "from the house, in this room, from this coloured pool table, I want the black ball" we would then be able to tell you that the ball is the number 8. This is how objects work. So, an array is like a list of data in front of you, an object is like pointing out an object from a large house, it can tend to need a little more instruction as each room and each pool table contains their own data. </p>
                <h2>Explain what functions are and why they are useful.</h2>
                <p>A function is a piece of code that can be used multiple times within code. It's something you would call to when you want a particular action done. Think of it like a "department" of code, like the marketing or finance department. Sometimes you have something that you want to be specifically done, and instead of painstakingly going through it yourself every day, you can call upon that department to do it for you. So if you are an admin person and need a particular document to be turned into a poster you can call upon marketingDepartment (that's what it would be called in code) and then they will do it for you, or in code talk, that document will run through that function.</p>
