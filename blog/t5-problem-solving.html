                <h1>Problem Solving</h1>
              <!-- Edit content -->
                <h2></h2>
                <p>During one of the modules (or "sprints" as we call them) I came across a bit of a road block. There were some code that needed to be written, however, I felt like I didn't have efficient enough knowledge yet to complete (or even begin) the writing of the code. So the first thing I did was re-read all the instructions to ensure that I understood them 100%. Then I went through the current code to see if I could reuse code to create the solution. It was then that I realised that I was a bit stuck as I had no idea where to even begin, the only thing I did know was that it required a certain piece of code that I could write, but the rest... I was a gonner. Ultimately I ended up speaking with one of the other guys in my cohort (class) and he mentioned he had the same issue and to take a look at a particular piece of code someone else had written. From there I was able to completely understand what they had written and I even modified it a bit to be a bit cleaner for me. It did feel stressful and frustrating as It did seem like I was thrown in the deep end... but ultimately I was able to complete the code as well as having a decent understanding of it too.</p>
                <h2>Reflect on how confident you feel using the problem solving techniques and process:</h2>
                <li>
                    <ul>
                        <strong>Pseudocode</strong>
                        <p>I feel pretty confident using pseudocode, it does make everything super easy to read and understand, but it's just turning it into real code that I can sometimes get stuck. I tend to use pseudocode in my head more often though... writing it down could make things easier.</p>
                    </ul>
                    <ul>
                        <strong>Trying something</strong>
                        <p>I feel really confident with trying something out as I can then change things around to get and understanding of how something actually works.</p>
                    </ul>
                    <ul>
                        <strong>Rubber ducky method</strong>
                        <p>I've never done this... but at times I feel like someone could do this for me, as if I was the rubber ducky (because freecodecamp sure as hell doesn't do it this way, and they should!)</p>
                    </ul>
                    <ul>
                        <strong>Reading error messages</strong>
                        <p>I've started to actually notice these, and utilise them. There's been a couple of times where I've actually solved an issue on my own purely just by taking a notice of the errors.</p>
                    </ul>
                    <ul>
                        <strong>Console.logging</strong>
                        <p>Never used it. So not so confident. I understand what it does though.</p>
                    </ul>
                    <ul>
                        <strong>Googling</strong>
                        <p>This is probably the highest on my list... because I can find a tutorial/explanation that suits my learning style.</p>
                    </ul>
                    <ul>
                        <strong>Asking your peers for help</strong>
                        <p>I've only had to do this once but it certainly made me feel confident as we were both stuck on the same section.</p>
                    </ul>
                    <ul>
                        <strong>Asking coaches for help</strong>
                        <p>I feel confident in asking the coaches, however I tend to like to try figure things out without having to bother them atm.</p>
                    </ul>
                    <ul>
                        <strong>Improving your process with reflection</strong>
                        <p>I do go back over sections to ensure I've understood them, and to understand where I initally went wrong in order to help me recover better next time.</p>
