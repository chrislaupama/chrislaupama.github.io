              <h1>Time and Habits</h1>

              <h3>Which timebox and habits techniques did you try?</h3>
              
              <p>
                The Pomodoro Technique seems right up my alley with a mix of timeboxing. I think that meditation is also something I've already started to slowly get into, but in a different sense from the norm. I've been using ASMR for a few months now and it's started to grow on me.
              </p>
              <h3>
                What did you find interesting?
              </h3>
              <p>
                I certainly find the meditation side of things interesting, as you can see how meditation affects the brain through scans etc. It's pretty fascinating and I think it's going to be something that will grow on me. I also found the Pomodoro Technique very interesting as it sort of fits my current workstlye at the moment but it now gives it some structure.
              </p>
              <h3>
                What worked for you?
              </h3>
              <p>
                The meditiaton worked, ASMR is something I really, really, really love.
              </p>
              <h3>
                Which will you experiment further with?
              </h3>
              <p>
                I will experiment with meditation more for sure, I'm keen to see how that goes, especially with the different techniques. I also really want to use the Pomodoro and Timebox techniques. I really like the way they structure things.
